Further notes:
 - Output of `git diff origin/master`, any other changes to the code? If so, please post them.
 - All third-party firewalls and custom iptables rules are unsupported. Please check the Docker docs about how to use Docker with your own ruleset. Nevertheless, iptabels output can help _us_ to help _you_: `iptables -L -vn`, `ip6tables -L -vn`, `iptables -L -vn -t nat` and `ip6tables -L -vn -t nat `
 - Check `docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf name=acme-mailcow) dig +short stackoverflow.com @172.22.1.254` (set the IP accordingly, if you changed the internal mailcow network) and `docker exec -it $(docker ps -qf name=acme-mailcow) dig +short stackoverflow.com @1.1.1.1` - output? Timeout?
 
 General logs:
- Please take a look at the [official documentation](https://mailcow.github.io/mailcow-dockerized-docs/debug-logs/).

Types to use Carbon in Doctrine

## Documentation

[Check how to use in the official Carbon documentation](https://carbon.nesbot.com/symfony/)

This package is an externalization of [src/Carbon/Doctrine](https://github.com/briannesbitt/Carbon/tree/2.71.0/src/Carbon/Doctrine)
from `nestbot/carbon` package.

Externalization allows to better deal with different versions of dbal. With
version 4.0 of dbal, it no longer sustainable to be compatible with all version
using a single code.

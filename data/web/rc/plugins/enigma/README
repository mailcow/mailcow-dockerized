Enigma Plugin for Roundcube

This plugin adds support for viewing and sending of signed and encrypted
messages in PGP (RFC 2440) and PGP/MIME (RFC 3156) format.

The plugin uses gpg binary on the server and stores all keys
(including private keys of the users) on the server.
Encryption/decryption is done server-side. So, this plugin
is for users that trust the server.


Implemented features:
---------------------
+ PGP: signatures verification
+ PGP: messages decryption
+ PGP: Sending of encrypted/signed messages
+ PGP: keys management UI (key import, export, delete)
+ PGP: key generation (client- or server-side)
+ Handling of PGP keys attached to incoming messages
+ User preferences to disable plugin features
+ Attaching public keys to email
+ Key server(s) support (search, import)


TODO:
-----
- Handling of big messages with temp files (? - security)
- Key info in contact details page (optional)
- Extended key management:
   - disable,
   - revoke,
   - change expiration date, change passphrase, add photo,
   - manage user IDs
   - export private keys
- Generate revocation certs
- Search filter to see invalid/expired keys
- Key server(s) support (upload, refresh)
- Mark keys as trusted/untrasted, display appropriate message in verify/decrypt status
- Support for multi-server installations (store keys in sql database? probably impossible with GnuPG 2.1)
- Performance improvements:
   - cache decrypted message key id so we can skip decryption if we have no password in session
   - cache (last or successful only?) sig verification status to not verify on every msg preview (optional)
- S/MIME: Certs generation (?)
- S/MIME: Certs management
- S/MIME: signed messages verification
- S/MIME: encrypted messages decryption
- S/MIME: Sending signed/encrypted messages
- S/MIME: Handling of certs attached to incoming messages
- S/MIME: Certificate info in Contacts details page (optional)


KNOWN ISSUES:
-------------
There are some known issues with accepting key passphrases on various
system configurations. This is caused by issues in PinEntry handling.
Make sure that vendor/bin/crypt-gpg-pinentry works from command line.

Possible reasons:
- non-working loader in shebang (#! /usr/bin/env php)
  Make sure it works for the user the php scripts are executed upon
  (i.e. apache, www-date, etc.)

Note: pinentry is used with gpg >= 2.0 and <= 2.1.12.
Note: for server use GnuPG developers still recommend version 1.4.

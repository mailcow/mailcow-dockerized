``block``
=========

Blocks are used for inheritance and act as placeholders and replacements at
the same time. They are documented in detail in the documentation for the
:doc:`extends<../tags/extends>` tag.

Block names must consist of alphanumeric characters, and underscores. The first char can't be a digit and dashes are not permitted.

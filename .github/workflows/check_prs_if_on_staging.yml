                   I noticed that you didn't select `staging` as your base branch. Please change the base branch to `staging`.
                   See the attached picture on how to change the base branch to `staging`:

      - name: Fail #we want to see failed checks in the PR
        if: ${{ success() }} #set exit code to 1 even if commenting somehow failed
        run: exit 1

  is_staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.pull_request.base.ref == 'staging' #check if the target branch is staging
    steps:
      - name: Success
        run: exit 0
